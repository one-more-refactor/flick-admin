## 2025-02-13 - Active Session Expiration Not Enforced Dynamically
**Vulnerability:** Sessions with an `expires_at` timestamp were only checked and discarded upon initial page reload/boot. Active users could remain logged in and interact with the panel indefinitely beyond the session's official expiration time without being logged out, unless they reloaded the page.
**Learning:** Checking the session expiration during the boot sequence ensures persistent state safety but neglects dynamic active session state changes.
**Prevention:** Set up active timer-based monitors (reactive Svelte `$effect` with `setTimeout` or similar schedulers) that trigger automatic client-side logout as soon as the session's expiration time passes.
